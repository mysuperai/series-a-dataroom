They are scaling fast, but can&#x27;t move fast enough. They have too much data to handle internally and so they want to outsource the data. Speed is more important than saving money right now. </li></ol><ol id="4246c165-a0c4-4d07-94ba-ddc0c254b933" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li><strong>Self-Service Labeling Tool</strong> - This can be a startup using machine learning, data science team within large company, etc. But in this case they have an exiting labeling team. For some reason they have chosen to label data internally, maybe they have sensitive data, private data, data that needs domain experts. They have a large group of people involved in labeling and need a centralized system. AI is a key helper for their business but maybe not core like as is the case with self-driving cars. The team is tasked with finding a solution to label data internally and is struggling with the build vs buy decision.</li></ol><ol id="994afe68-1e2b-496a-84a3-3cfff5a39d4f" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li><strong>Hybrid Solution</strong> - This is a large tech company with a mature data science team. They have the money, time, and resources. Their goal is to be an AI first company and as such AI is core to the business strategy.. They are so profitable they can &quot;waste money&quot; on building internal infrastructure (what is $10M to these guys?).  They can build it themselves, but money is also such a commodity if they could use something externally, that also makes sense. They prefer to build and customize solutions themselves then outsource to scale the labeling. </li></ol><p id="c0cc0ac6-eede-452d-b5b6-00e50582d4c3" class="">
</p><p id="0457bab4-4c7a-4174-82b9-9def16cb7750" class="">Amit is actually quite good at Machine Learning, even though he doesn&#x27;t code anymore he is up-to-date on the latest activity. </p><p id="84c63057-f6d2-48df-8d2c-a9127afa7659" class="">He doesn&#x27;t need a lot of education or help with Machine Learning, but <strong>doesn&#x27;t know a lot about getting high quality data</strong>.  Given enough time he could likely build his own labeling solution but it doesn&#x27;t really make sense for him, since he realized he should focus on his core value add. He thinks outsource labeling solutions are &quot;dumb&quot; labor. He wants to focus on building his own models and doesn&#x27;t want to outsource the core design of the task. He has an internal labeling team he uses to iterate quickly, optimizes instructions, tasks design, etc. And when he&#x27;s confident, he wants to outsource the task to a crowd to scale the labeling. </p><p id="954216ff-89ed-4bac-b103-a5affcbcfe6d" class="">He values transparency and control in solutions, and wants to be able to build and adjust things quickly himself and not wait for his vendor to change it. </p><p id="ad1dea78-74d8-43b6-8f63-816ee9e7410e" class="">He spends a lot of time checking metrics, and preparing presentations for the rest of the company. He helps the team in debugging the ML pipelines, and coming up with ideas on how to improve it. He spends time educating the executives of the power and benefit of Machine Learning. He really really wants to move fast and make progress!</p><h3 id="5be058b2-0d7c-4b1b-a307-8c70fb92af0c" class="">Market Size</h3><p id="9e1f6021-0d1b-4ec9-8d4f-a80919ecbc11" class="">Of our two target customer profiles, Amit reflects a venture-sized market opportunity (though much smaller than Customer Profile #2 below): super.AI&#x27;s market opportunity for Amit buyers today is $15B growing at a CAGR of 43%.

Amit is willing to pay high six-figure ACV contracts. Amit is leading a mature data science team that has an enterprise R&amp;D budget, where ~10% of that budget is applied to labeling data. </p><h3 id="3214f83d-fa38-43e5-a3c1-d5879daa244e" class=""><strong>What problem are we solving for him?</strong></h3><p id="39b72828-c5cf-48e8-b534-2625e18b823a" class="">For the “Amits” of the world, the success KPI is minimizing generalization error of a machine learning model on a test set, so that Amit can use that model in his business.</p><p id="bbe7228f-b3b1-478a-b7f1-57f30b7f8526" class="">Having high quality, varied, data at scale is the biggest blocker for his team. He tends to prefer a human only labeling approach, but is okay with AI assisted labeling, pre-labels, and active learning (although has some doubts whether active learning really works). </p><p id="e50798fa-2fd0-4cbd-a3c7-dfc7c1094a0b" class="">He needs really high quality data. He needs it to be 100% pixel perfect, because they will use it to train their machine learning model which will be 80-90% in production. He is happy that the system can handle edge cases very well, because edge cases are important in their application.</p><p id="175c8684-9caa-4727-88da-09580d7d19b8" class="">They are moving so fast and have so much pressure on them to deliver, coupled with the fact that they have either venture funding or a big budget (from the internal company), that time is precious.   They need a good price relative to the market, but there is not a clear economic value tied to labeling.</p><p id="fae8827d-4142-4afb-8c36-9758fba68e03" class="">It should be very fast to get started, with minimal integration via an API or SDK that they can hook to their existing pipeline.</p><p id="00d70240-fc5e-47d7-b715-e9e113e99efd" class="">They have so much data, they can&#x27;t handle it all internally, so the solution needs to be able to handle big data coming in batches. But at the same time they need a gaurantee that they can get hundreds of thousand data points labeled every month- gauranteed, with very high quality. They need to get data back at a very high velocity &lt; 5 business days with &gt; 99% accuracy.</p><p id="1b00bc87-09a3-4bd2-8b86-089d0084ed89" class="">He has 5 or 6 different labeling pipelines, which different priorities. He needs a way to review the data to make sure it&#x27;s high quality. He needs data programs specific to his need (e.g. 3D semantic segmentation)</p><p id="7f22a499-7ad0-4e33-a154-1991679c1aad" class="">He needs a way to quickly, and easily modify the product including the instructions, giving feedback to the crowd, changing the task, marking data as correct or incorrect, etc. He wants a debugging tool that he can try himself and ask the super.AI crowd for feedback.</p><p id="7eddee15-6a36-4fea-9b61-4d5e08547762" class="">It needs to be very easy (API or click of the button) to integrate into his own data review flow, data processing flow, so that he can label whenever he wants. He wants humane labeling because image is important for them.</p><p id="18375470-14f3-4070-888a-dbb904bce975" class="">He love having access to training data domain experts, which allowed them to receive timely and effective advice throughout their initial integration and beyond.</p><h3 id="a2ca498e-5909-46b4-abcd-18fd8865d58b" class=""><strong>What benefits are we bringing him?</strong></h3><p id="a3c4726e-bcf6-464c-baaf-5d88f5ee6421" class="">Amit and his team are advanced, they know what they are doing and want to get their hands dirty, iterate fast, understand the problem and customize the labeling to their exact needs. If they need to change something they don&#x27;t want to wait for a vendor to change it they want to change it themselves. <strong>We built the Data Program builder, for this precise reason. </strong></p><p id="ab730a46-e70e-4e51-87e8-bea63ea7a627" class="">They are happy that super.AI makes it easy to focus on developing leading AI technology rather than the operations of labeling data. It&#x27;s more interesting, but it also gives them more agility as a company.</p><p id="8f88f382-3bad-47fe-b6cd-aca6e5633bbb" class=""><strong>They have in-house labelers, and want to experiment with their models, the task design instructions, and really lock it down before outsourcing it to a less sophisticated crowd. With the </strong><strong><a href="http://super.AI">Super.AI</a></strong><strong> platform they can seamlessly do all of these things. </strong>They can design a custom data program from scratch with the Data Program Builder, then label with the self service Ai powered labeling tools, add their models to the system for active learning, pre-labeling, quality assurance, model training, and when the task is ready outsource to a large scalable crowd and get guaranteed accuracy. </p><p id="63a497fe-fdd9-4c08-868b-e97b04f37639" class="">Amit especially loves that he can quickly test out many different labeling sources. He&#x27;s happy that <a href="http://super.AI">super.AI</a> quickly finds the best labeling agents for him (whether it’s Super.AI&#x27;s, meta AI, generalist humans, specialized humans, or other labeling companies etc). With this approach, Amit always gets the best of what the market has to offer given his priorities (whether it’s quality/accuracy, cost, or speed).</p><p id="6b1d9678-f28a-4f48-aed6-a63b069d1011" class="">He is looking for very good customer service, that is happy that super.AI provides consistent top-notch support through a number of channels, including a direct Slack channels with engineers. They are happy that super.AI responds to requirements quickly, with a short conversation, roll out projects in a week, with minimal development time from them. They are happy that the super.AI QA team is careful and quick to seek clarification, and their attention to detail has produced some truly impressive results.</p><h3 id="fccaf75e-2ac0-428c-a57a-7db02f797eb0" class=""><strong>What delights him?</strong></h3><p id="6e257060-3a3a-43a1-94f0-f546b97ea7ee" class="">No longer does Amit have to spend his days doing</p><p id="65f2f359-bbd9-4dda-9996-f6beabf6bd47" class=""><em>undifferentiated heavy-lifting</em></p><p id="cd656673-cbac-4cc3-ad6a-5a67a0e59e8d" class="">writing instructions for labelers (the most time consuming piece), monitoring crowd quality, fixing low quality data, starting over every time the data needs to change. He can get started in a few hours, customize the project as little or as much as he likes. He can add data from an API, cloud storage, on-prem databases, a web dashboard, or anything that fits into his normal workflow. In addition he can add his own custom models to the platform, label data himself, outsource to labelers, monitor the quality, and link his data scientist and the crowd under a single platform. With the data engine no longer does Amit need to spend 100x more than he needs to train his model. And with the ability to use any labeling source, he no longer does he need to use conflicting formats to find the best offering. He can test the whole market in one place: Super.AI. He gets exactly what he wants, as though there was someone next to him helping with task instructions, feedback, and reviewing quality.

He has access to a software team who setup a digital pipeline, but it is humans doing the mundane work of processing unstructured data. Some of the pipeline is actually automated with software, but still mostly done by humans. They built this pipeline because it&#x27;s solving a clear pain point, they know how much it costs them to run this pipeline, they know the current quality, cost, and latency. 

HIs predecessor initially setup this human pipeline when the line-of-business was smaller, but now that it&#x27;s scaling quickly it&#x27;s hard to scale this pipeline, both from a time, money, and complexity perspective. They would love to outsource this for the right price, and assuming it&#x27;s quality enough.

They have realized that they can automate the pipeline with AI or software, and actually have on their roadmap, but it always get&#x27;s pushed off, because there&#x27;s always something more important for the data science team, or software team to work on. </p><h3 id="6086bb03-8264-4f60-8334-da87204c1dcd" class="">Market Size </h3><p id="deb5df1c-f931-4031-b0fc-1ee60fb3f169" class="">Callum represents a huge market opportunity for super.AI.

If someone just said &quot;labeling&quot; it could be easy to miss this distinction. Larger more mature data science teams will have in-house labelers, and the biggest tech companies have even built infrastructure to handle the labeling (Microsoft→HRS, Google→Endor, Facebook→SRT, etc.). Even though they have these tools they can&#x27;t keep up with the scale at which they need labeling. For the more advanced and mature data science teams like Ebay and HP they take full advantage of things like the data program builder, the self-service labeling tools, the customization features, and the Meta AI infrastructure before sending out to an outsourced crowd. Before us this would take a lot of time, because they would have to convert the project from their internal tools to the external vendors tool, and they would lose control, and if they wanted to change anything it would be a pain. But with <a href="http://super.AI">super.AI</a> you get this on in a single platform. For example, we designed the Meta AI infrastructure to make hooking in their own models (or open source model), designing labeling workflows, and making sure data is high quality very easy. We view the actual models as the commoditized part that the FAANG collectively invests $2B+/year in developing. They would outsource the labeling and hookup their models to assist, but not outsource the model building part. Our value proposition for them is creating a single platform that connects the data scientist, with the AI models, and the labelers in a single place.</p><p id="26c8030e-8322-46bf-8d12-38cec1ee8777" class="">The Callum market on the other hand prefers to use the platform as an API integration. They like to treat it as a black box where they can send their data into and like magic get the data out. They want the data to be high quality, given to them fast enough, at a reasonable price and at the end of the day it&#x27;s less important how they get it, and if humans or AI labels the data. </p><h2 id="12b859e1-e44c-4e52-9e78-41d1dfa4b158" class="">Uses of AI for these Markets </h2><p id="9ff82607-d01e-4da7-9910-00ec59e0403c" class="">We want to take a moment and decouple &quot;AI for data labeling.&quot; The problem with a new field is that something the jargon is not well defined. I think it&#x27;s natural to bunch this concept into a single bucket, whereas there are different concepts that compose &quot;AI powered labeling&quot;. There are a number of things related to AI powered labeling and so if someone claims they are doing this, or don&#x27;t want it they may be referencing one of these, it&#x27;s unlikely they are referencing everything here.</p><p id="2c758999-b1b1-4150-a35f-2e7c7094ebff" class="">There is first what we all <strong>auto labeling, </strong>this is where there is no human is involved (it&#x27;s only sent to the AI). The Callum demographic prefers auto labeling (assuming the quality is good). Amit on the other hand has a preference against auto labeling. But AI in the <a href="http://super.AI">super.AI</a> platform goes well beyond just auto labeling </p><p id="c3543b10-b439-4cfc-8ff4-8f95eb5281ce" class="">There is <strong>pre-labeling. </strong>This is where the human is still labeling the data, but the AI sends suggestions to the labeler before they start labeling. The makes the labeling process much faster because the AI only adds predictions where it is highly certain, and the human can focus on the most difficult pieces. Amit can add his own models to the pre-labeling process and just use the <a href="http://super.AI">super.AI</a> infrastructure to speed up his internal and external labeling. Callum will use our models for pre-labeling. </p><p id="495a378b-9ecd-4fa5-83de-94f261268a9b" class="">Next there is <strong>AI assisted labeling. </strong>This is where the AI makes predictions in real time given input from the user. The user can correct or modify the labels and the AI will automatically update the annotations in real time. For example instead of having to segment and entire car you can just draw a box around it and the AI will segment it in real time and you can adjust it as well in real-time. These tools still use humans but save a significant amount of time.</p><p id="824e642f-806a-42c0-bc11-5ce428264888" class="">There is A<strong>ctive Learning. </strong>Active learning selects the data points which would benefit the model most. The benefit of active learning is that you can train your model faster with less data. </p><p id="64a0c09b-87b9-453d-b1fc-26955e0e678b" class="">Next comes <strong>Data Boosting</strong>. Data boosting is similar to active learning in that its goal is to train a machine learning model faster, but it&#x27;s focused on finding edge cases by finding similar data to data the model got incorrect and &quot;boosting&quot; the amount of data of that class. </p><p id="54db663d-a1d0-429f-bb43-e387faa8487a" class="">There are S<strong>urrogate Models</strong>. Surrogate models are used for debugging labeling tasks. They are generic machine learning classification models with 1000&#x27;s of classes that find a correlation in tasks that were incorrect and the classes the model produced. For example maybe one of the output classes of the model is &quot;blurry image,&quot; and it just so happened that 87% of the incorrect data points the surrogate model predicted &quot;blurry image&quot;, and 10% of the correct points it predicted &quot;blurry image.&quot; This may be a good indication that a problem is with &quot;blurry images.&quot;</p><p id="22fae17b-e64e-48c9-9c02-f5081fc4d7df" class="">Finally there is <strong>AI Powered QA. </strong>This is where instead of the human checking the accuracy of the model, the model checks the accuracy of the human. Every ML model has an expected distribution of answers, when the human&#x27;s prediction is too different it will throw a flag. </p><p id="f7736360-ac68-430b-924a-b35bf44eacd7" class="">Tesla for example uses most of these techniques for labeling their self-driving car data, but it&#x27;s hard-coded to their exact application. We make this generic, programmable, and modular so that anyone can use it. </p><h2 id="f42249ba-abc3-4d16-983f-fb9ad3fc120b" class="">A Time Bound Market Difference</h2><p id="8c0a0d0c-3177-4694-8107-2d99da8f8863" class="">We believe eventually just like nearly every company not has software developers, in the next 5-10 years nearly every company will have data scientists and as a result in-house labeling teams, and a dedicated budget to &quot;data processing.&quot; And so the distinction between the extremely advanced Amit&#x27;s and less advanced Callum&#x27;s will amalgamate into a very similar market, just like is the case with software development. </p><p id="93d6e43f-c212-44ac-844f-9045b55c20e4" class="">Even the least advanced &quot;old-school&quot; companies have developers. Programming is not very old and data science is moving even faster, there&#x27;s an explosion of data scientists and data. It&#x27;s going to be a new standard that beyond software developers you will have data scientists. At that point in time everything he said about &quot;doing in house&quot; will be true, they will use use the DP builder, labeling tools, meta AI, and then outsource to the crowd for the scale.</p><h2 id="f4ff0545-0402-445b-b889-266c646c3b34" class="">Comparison to Data Robot like Solutions</h2><p id="2d76b10c-89af-44b6-abaa-d6280b6c76d8" class="">It&#x27;s clear Amit wouldn&#x27;t use a DataRobot like solution, but why wouldn&#x27;t a Callum use it instead of super.Ai? The short answer is that it serves a very different problem than Super.AI. The Data Robots, Dataiku, H2O, Google AutoML, etc. of the world  don&#x27;t exist to replace humans doing BPO like tasks on unstructured data but to replace open-source software. They are in-fact not good enough to replace humans in BPO-like tasks. These solutions excel in structured data tasks typically in cases where global insights are needed, such as in fraud detection, recommendation engines, detecting trends, and regressions. Human&#x27;s aren&#x27;t very good at these tasks anyways. <a href="http://super.ai/">Super.AI</a>, works well on tasks that humans are good at - local tasks on unstructured data, that&#x27;s quick complex. This is precisely the cases where these other approaches fall short.</p><p id="490a18f2-0bd3-4858-a5a4-09511d5f3d7e" class="">
